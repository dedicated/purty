Web development aka "Pretty wrappers around databases."

A repo to store our favourite defaults and set ups for various frameworks that we've had the (not so) fine luck to encounter.

This might include dev-opsy stuff like Chef, Puppet, Fabric, Vagrant files.
It might include Gemfiles,Capistrano scripts, pip requirements.txt, Fabric files.

In general, stuff that aims at making *less* drugery and you've found a good use for and crucially, simplifies things.

Go ahead, save us all time with your opinionated defaults! Worker solidarity etc etc etc
